## ✨ Features

- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: carefully curated Green, Blue, and Yellow color palette inspired by nature and ink wash paintings.
- **Gesture Control**: Adjust volume by circling your mouse around the center button (Clockwise to increase, Counter-clockwise to decrease).
- **Tangible Visual Feedback**: A "tangible" yellow aura ring that expands and solidifies as volume increases.
- **Breathing Rhythm**: Synchronized breathing animations on the button and ring to promote a sense of calm.
- **Pure Web Audio**: High-quality brown noise generated in real-time using the Web Audio API.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

High-end, organic design with a focus on "tangibility" and "breath".
- **Center Button**: Softly blurred edges for a gentle feel.
- **Volume Ring**: Sharpens and becomes more opaque at higher volumes, providing tactile visual feedback.
- **Interaction**: No sliders or standard inputs. Just organic circular motion.
